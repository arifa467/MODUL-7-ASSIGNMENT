        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpreted languages execute the code line by line using an interpreter (e.g., Python, JavaScript).\n",
        "\n",
        "Compiled languages are translated into machine code by a compiler before execution (e.g., C, C++).\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpreted languages are easier to debug and are platform-independent but generally slower. Compiled languages are faster but require recompilation after changes.\n",

        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Exception handling in Python is a technique used to handle errors during program execution without crashing the program.\n",
        "It uses the following blocks:\n",
        "\n",
        "try: contains code that may raise an exception\n",
        "\n",
        "except: handles the exception if one occurs\n",

        "finally: always runs, used for clean-up actions\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "The finally block is used to write code that should run no matter what—whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
        "It is commonly used to release resources like closing files or database connections, even if an error happens.\n",

        "The gc module allows manual control of garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "The else block runs only if no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
        "It is used when you want to run some code only after successful execution of the try block, and not during error handling.\n",
